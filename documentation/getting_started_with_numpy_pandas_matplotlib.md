# Indroduction to Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

Much of the research that you do this summer will be using these three python libraries. They form the backbone of scientefic computing in python. There are some examples in the notebooks that are more specific to some of the research that we do. 

If you want a more general intoduction to some of the capabilities of these libraries I highly recommend checking out this [Github repo](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook). It contains exerpts and code from the book [Python Data Science Handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) by Jake VanderPlas.
